# PRX.org Version 4
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PRX/PRX.org-Frontend.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PRX/PRX.org-Frontend)

    Note: This repository houses only the web frontend
    component of PRX.org Version 4. In order to use it,
    you will need a working version of the API or backend
    component, available at [PRX/PRX.org-Backend](/PRX/PRX.org-Backend).
    If you want to contribute to the frontend without needing
    to change the backend, you can use our live backend, but
    may be subject to rate-limiting.

## Getting Started
The quickest way to get started is to check out the repository and execute it against our live v4 backend, in just a few commands. You will need to have a recent version of NodeJS and NPM installed.

```shell
git clone git://github.com/PRX/PRX.org-Frontend.git prx4-fe
cd prx4-fe
npm install
npm run-script devServer
```

After executing the above, opening a web browser to `http://localhost:8080/` should display your own version of the page. Any changes you make to the files in the `src/` directory will automatically be reflected on the page - either by updating it in place or by automatically forcing the page to refresh.

## Architecture
Version 4 of PRX.org is implemented as a pair of applications â€“ a *backend* which is executed by the server and implemented using Ruby on Rails, and a *frontend* which is executed by web browsers and implemented using AngularJS.

### General Principles
The application is built in javascript using AngularJS and Stylus (a CSS-like language which compiles to CSS).

#### Compiled
Because of the nature of optimizations which need to take place when serving rich web applications, this project has a build process which performs these optimizations before and during deployment.

Most of this process is handled by Gulp. During development, gulp continuously `build`s the project and runs the tests to ensure that they continue to pass. On the integration server, after these tests have passed, those assets are further compressed and optimized (`compile`d) and the same tests are executed against the new assets. During deployment, assets are `compile`d and tested on the deployment server. Deployments fail if these tests do not pass.

#### Dependencies
Dependencies on libraries are handled using `npm` and dependencies on browser packages are handled using `bower`. NPM will automatically invoke bower correctly as part of the `npm install` process.

#### Testing
This project should be well unit tested. There are (fairly low) code coverage requirements on the suites that will cause them to fail integration if they are not met. Tests are written with Jasmine.

End to End tests are useful but because they are coupled to both the frontend and backend simultaneously they can largely be ignored for the time being. A solution is being devised that will more fully work to continuously integrate this process.

##### Travis CI
Tests are automatically run by Travis CI in several circumstances. Generally, this is used to ensure that `master` always passes (see [*Master is Always Deployable*](#master-is-always-deployable), below) and for visibility into test statuses on Pull Requests.

#### Deploying
Deployment is handled through Capistrano. If you have access to commit directly to this repo, you probably have deploy permissions as well. If you don't, you will likely need to customize the deployment scripts anyway, so it will not be addressed in detail here. The basics are these:

```shell
cap production deploy # deploys to m.prx.org, *always* from master
cap staging deploy # deploys to m-staging.prx.org, allows specifying the branch
```

If you're prompted for a password, you don't have access to deploy. If you think this is a mistake, email chris.

##### Master is Always Deployable
We're able to make very little ceremony out of deploying because master is always deployable (and, in fact, will likely be automatically deployed in the future). We maintain this state of affairs by ensuring that our code is well-tested ([automatically](#testing), with help from [Travis CI](#Travis-CI)) and by following a code review process that uses Github Pull Requests to ensure that at least two people have looked at each set of changes.

### Project Layout
The project is broken into several directories. Everything that is automatically generated as part of the build process (mentioned above) is ignored by git and therefore never checked into source control. For this reason, I will refer to directories that are not visible in the Github source tree, but will be automatically generated as part of the `npm install` or `npm run-script devServer` processes.

#### `config/`
All configuration details are stored in this folder, including

File               | Description
-----------------: | :--------------------------------
`build.json`         | Most of the details about which files are used by which build target
`deploy.rb`          | Used by Capistrano for deployment
`flags.*.json`       | `build` and `compile` time flags which are automatically inserted into the code. Useful for situations where it is important to optimize varying behavior out before deploying.
`karma.conf.js      | Used by `karma` to run unit tests.
`protractor.conf.js` | Used by `protractor` to run end to end tests.

#### `src/`
Home for application files.

##### `src/app`
*coming soon*

##### `src/common`
*coming soon*

##### `src/stylus`
*coming soon*

##### `src/assets`
*coming soon*

#### `public/` and `bin/`
Files here are automatically generated and any changes made to them will be lost. You should make changes in the `src/` directory, where they will be automatically picked up and updated where appropriate.

Files generated by the `build` process are put in the `public/` directory. When you access the server started by `npm run-script devServer`, the files you are using are served from this directory. While this script is running, any changes made will automatically be reflected in the `public/` directory.

Files generated by the `compile` process are put in the `bin/` directory. These are further compressed and minified versions of the files put in the `public/` directory, and may use different versions of vendor assets.

#### `vendor/` and `node_modules/`

Files managed by `bower` and `npm`, respectively, live here. *Changes made to these files directly will be lost.* The packages and versions of those packages that will be put in these folders are specified by `bower.json` and `package.json`, respectively.

#### `lib/`

Files that exist to support the build and deploy processes live here.
