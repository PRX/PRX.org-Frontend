        h1 PRX Privacy Policy
        p
          | Your use of the PRX Web site constitutes your
          | agreement to this privacy policy and consent to
          | the terms herein. Please see <a href="#collect">
          | Information We Collect and How We Use It</a> to
          | learn more about our collection and use of user
          | information.
        h2 Introduction
        p
          | PRX is committed to safeguarding the privacy of visitors
          | to our Web site and users of the other services available
          | through our site (the "Service(s)"). We will use our best
          | efforts to ensure that the information you provide us remains
          | private and is used only for the purposes set forth herein.
        p
          | This privacy policy details our commitment to protect your
          | information and the limited manner in which we will use that
          | information to provide and improve our provision of the Services.
        h2 Important Terms Used Throughout This Privacy Policy
        p
          | Throughout this privacy policy we use several specialized terms.
          | "Personally Identifiable Information" is information that tells
          | us specifically who you are, like your name, street address, email
          | address, billing address, credit card number and expiration date.
          | "User Information" means all Personally Identifiable Information
          | and any other forms of information discussed in this privacy policy,
          | including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user's computer. We
          | use the term "aggregate" when we combine information from various
          | persons or users. Information is said to be "anonymized" if it does
          | not identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular
          | person or entity with such information.
        h2 Information We Collect and How We Use It <a name="collect">&nbsp;</a>
        p
          | If you visit our site to browse, we will only collect and store the
          | domain name and host from which a user accessed the Internet (e.g.,
          | aol.com), the IP address of the user's computer, the user's browser
          | software and operating system, the date and time the user accesses
          | the site and the Internet address of any Web site from which the user
          | linked directly to our site or to which the user links after visiting
          | our site. PRX also automatically collects information about your
          | interactions with media content on third-party sites that include
          | our Embeddable Player. We use this information to measure the number
          | of visitors to sections of our sites, to determine from where our
          | visitors linked and to where our visitors link from the sites and
          | to help us make our sites more useful. For example, we organize and
          | analyze IP addresses so that we can provide efficient service, enhance
          | security, monitor appropriate usage and produce traffic volume statistics.
          | This type of information is sometimes shared with third parties, such as
          | when we aggregate and disclose site traffic information for marketing
          | purposes. When we share such information with third parties we will
          | require them to abide by the standards of this privacy policy.
        p
          | If you register or engage in a transaction while at our site, to make
          | full use of our Services you will need to complete our registration process.
          | We collect and store the Personally Identifiable Information you provide
          | through this registration process, including your user ID and password,
          | which we may elect to provide for you. If you engage in a transaction while
          | logged on to our site, then we collect and store information about the
          | transaction. If you send us communications, then we may collect such
          | communications in a file specific to you.
        p
          | We use the information we collect from you as a registered user to build
          | features that we hope will make the Services more attractive and easier
          | for you to use. This may include better customer support and timely notice
          | of new services. We may share User Information with our partners and
          | affiliates that are committed to serving your need for the Services and
          | improving your user experience, but will require such third parties to
          | abide by the standards of this privacy policy. We may also share aggregate
          | anonymized data relating to activity on the site and use of the Services,
          | such as demographical and statistical information, for marketing, research
          | and other purposes. Furthermore, we may need to disclose User Information
          | to law enforcement or other government officials if appropriate for your
          | protection or in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual
          | property infringement or other activity that is illegal or may expose us
          | or our users to legal liability.
        p
          | We use a Google Analytics feature based on Display Advertising that collects
          | demographic and interest information about our visitors. We use this
          | information to better target sponsor messaging within the products we
          | create. Visitors can easily opt-out of the collection of this information
          | by using the <a href="//www.google.com/settings/ads">Ads Settings</a>
          | or using the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">Google
          | Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.
        h2 If You Do Not Wish to Disclose User Information
        p
          | If you do not want to provide us with certain User Information then you
          | may opt out by not using the Service that provides us with such User
          | Information. For example, if you do not want us to retain your name, then
          | you may choose not to become a registered user. You will not be entitled
          | to the benefits of registration, but you are still free to browse the site
          | and to visit the parts of the site accessible to non-registrants.
        h2 Cookies
        p
          | Cookies are small text files that our site can send to your browser for
          | storage on your hard drive. Cookies can make your use of our site easier
          | by saving your status and preferences upon visits to our site. The cookies
          | are refreshed every time you enter the site. Most browsers are initially
          | set to accept cookies, but you may be able to change the settings to refuse
          | cookies or to be alerted when cookies are being sent. We use cookies for
          | two purposes: (1) to enable PRX to customize information for certain segments
          | of its customer base; and (2) in some instances, to associate you with your
          | User Information. For example, through the use of cookies you may log in
          | automatically and thereby save you time. Rejection of cookies will interfere
          | with your ability to log in and use certain interactive Services on the site.
        h2 Control of Your Password
        p
          | Except as specifically permitted by this privacy policy or your User Agreement
          | you may not disclose your PRX password to any third parties nor share it with
          | any third parties. If you lose control of your PRX password you may lose control
          | over your Personally Identifiable Information, and you will be responsible for
          | any legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password
          | has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password
          | or, if we provided your password, notify PRX so that we may issue you a new password.
        h2 Removal or Correction of Personally Identifiable Information
        p
          | You may also "Unsubscribe" from the site by emailing help with the subject
          | "unsubscribe" and your username in the message. We will email you back as
          | soon as your account has been disabled. This will have the effect of
          | concealing the information that you provided upon registration from users
          | of the site, other than administrators. If you unsubscribe, you will lose
          | access to the parts of the site for which you must provide such Personally
          | Identifiable Information in order to gain access.
        p
          | If your Personally Identifiable Information is edited by you, we will not
          | make any attempt to apply your edit to backup copies that we may have of
          | the information, and in the event that it is necessary for us to restore
          | our database from a backup, it is possible that your edit would be lost
          | and the information previous to your edit would be restored. In such an
          | event, we might not be able to determine that this had happened. Your
          | recourse in such a case is to edit the information again.
        p
          | If you unsubscribe, the Personally Identifiable Information in your user
          | record will not be displayed to users other than administrators. In
          | addition, content or materials you have posted or uploaded to the site
          | will no longer be displayed to users other than administrators, with
          | the exception of certain materials that may be required for proper
          | functioning of the Services (e.g., a piece licensed by a station will
          | be viewable and downloadable by that station for the remaining term
          | of the license). Information, content, and materials may be retained
          | in our database and backup copies thereof, for our records, and as
          | necessary for us to comply with governmental orders, resolve disputes,
          | troubleshoot problems, enforce any agreement you have entered into
          | through our sites and as otherwise deemed reasonably necessary by us.
        h2 Underage Users
        p
          | If you are under 13 years of age, do not send us any information about
          | yourself, including your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail
          | address. If we discover that we have collected any personally identifying
          | information from a child under the age of 13, we will remove that information
          | from our records as soon as possible.
        h2 Third Parties
        p
          | This privacy policy only addresses the use and disclosure of User
          | Information collected by PRX. If you disclose information to other
          | parties, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of
          | such information regardless of their affiliation or relationship
          | with PRX. Because PRX does not control the privacy practices of
          | third parties you are subject to the privacy customs and policies
          | of those third parties. When you link to another Web site, you are
          | subject to the privacy policy of that Web site. We encourage you to
          | ask questions and review the applicable privacy policy before you
          | disclose your personal information to third parties.
        p
          | We do not try to control, and disclaim responsibility for, information
          | provided by other users or third parties that is made available through
          | our site. Such information may contain errors, intentional or otherwise,
          | or may be offensive, inappropriate or inaccurate, and in some cases may
          | be mislabeled or deceptively labeled.
        h2 Miscellaneous
        p
          | PRX may from time to time change this privacy policy with or without
          | notice, so please check it regularly for any changes or updates. For
          | future reference, PRX will make a link to the current privacy policy
          | available to you on your screen when you are on our Web site. Your use
          | of the site constitutes your agreement to this privacy policy and your
          | assent to any modification thereto.
